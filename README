*Elastfix*

A small jQuery plugin to help fix the iOS 5 elastic scrolling issue when you prevent touchmove on the html body, 
but want to allow the CSS property "-webkit-overflow-scroll: touch;" to work correctly.

For more info about this, follow @missingdesign on twitter. Find me on Forrst.com as @_jordan.

After I created this I stumbled on something by @joelambert, that's just straight js, and seems to work just as good. 
I'm not sure if it works dynamically added content, but should be easy to work with, see:
